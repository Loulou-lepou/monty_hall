The Monty Hall problem was first featured on the classic game show "Let's make a Deal". In the final segment of the show, contestants were presented with a choice of three different doors. Behind two of the doors would be a goat, and behind the third would be an extravagant prize such as a car.
The contestant begins the game by picking one door. The host, Monty Hall, would then open one of the remaining doors. Monty never opens the door which contained the car. The door Monty opens always contains a goat. At this point, the contestant was presented with a decision:

1) Open the originally selected door
2) Switch to the other unopened door

In this post, I will examine the theoretical probability of each selection, and then I will use Python to test and prove the theory.
